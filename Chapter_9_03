"""
Permanently Deleting Files and Folders
You can delete a single file or a single empty folder with functions in the
os module, whereas to delete a folder and all of its contents, you use the
shutil module.
• Calling os.unlink(path) will delete the file at path.
• Calling os.rmdir(path) will delete the folder at path. This folder must be
empty of any files or folders.
• Calling shutil.rmtree(path) will remove the folder at path, and all files
and folders it contains will also be deleted.
"""
"""
If you had any important files ending with .rxt, they would have been
accidentally, permanently deleted. Instead, you should have first run the
program like this:
"""
import os
for filename in os.listdir():
  if filename.endswith('.rxt'):
  #os.unlink(filename)
  print(filename)

"""
Using shutil.rmtree(path)
"""
os.chdir ("C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created")
shutil.rmtree ("C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\Reports")
