"""
The extractall() method for ZipFile objects extracts all the files and folders
from a ZIP file into the current working directory.

After running this code, the contents of example.zip will be extracted
to C:\. Optionally, you can pass a folder name to extractall() to have it
extract the files into a folder other than the current working directory.

If the folder passed to the extractall() method does not exist, it will be created.

import os
import zipfile
ext_me = zipfile.ZipFile (".\\Pragim.zip")
ext_me.extractall (".\\extracted") # a new folder will be created if not already exists. This does not happen with "copy, move or rename"
ext_me.close()

"""
The extract() method for ZipFile objects will extract a single file from
the ZIP file. Continue the interactive shell example:

Optionally, you can pass a second argument to
extract() to extract the file into a folder other than the current working
directory. If this second argument is a folder that doesnâ€™t yet exist, Python
will create the folder.
