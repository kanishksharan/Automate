Calling shutil.move(source, destination) will move the file or folder at the path
source to the path destination and will return a string of the absolute path of
the new location.
If destination points to a folder, the source file gets moved into destination
and keeps its current filename.

"""
Assuming a folder named eggs already exists in the C:\ directory, this
shutil.move() calls says, “Move C:\bacon.txt into the folder C:\eggs.”
If there had been a bacon.txt file already in C:\eggs, it would have been
overwritten. Since it’s easy to accidentally overwrite files in this way, you
should take some care when using move().

shutil.move ("C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\Oracle_11g\\Pragim\\Reports","C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created")
#O/P = 'C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\Reports'

"""
The destination path can also specify a filename. In the following
example,
the source file is moved and renamed.
"""
shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs\\new_bacon.txt')
# O/P = 'C:\\eggs\\new_bacon.txt'

"""
In the below mentioned example, move() can’t find a folder named eggs in the C:\ directory and so
assumes that destination must be specifying a filename, not a folder. So the
bacon.txt text file is renamed to eggs (a text file without the .txt file extension)—
probably not what you wanted!

shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs')
