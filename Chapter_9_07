Creating and Adding to ZIP Files
To create your own compressed ZIP files, you must open the ZipFile object
in write mode by passing 'w' as the second argument. (This is similar to
opening a text file in write mode by passing 'w' to the open() function.)
When you pass a path to the write() method of a ZipFile object, Python
will compress the file at that path and add it into the ZIP file. The write()
methodâ€™s first argument is a string of the filename to add. The second argument
is the compression type parameter, which tells the computer what algorithm
it should use to compress the files; you can always just set this value to
zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED. (This specifies the deflate compression algorithm, which
works well on all types of data.)

zipme.write (".\\extracted",compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) # Pass the item to be zipped
