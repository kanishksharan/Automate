Matching Newlines with the Dot Character
The dot-star will match everything except a newline. By passing re.DOTALL as
the second argument to re.compile(), you can make the dot character match
all characters, including the newline character.
Enter the following into the interactive shell:
"""

import re

noNewlineRegex = re.compile('.*')
mo = noNewlineRegex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.')
print (mo.group())

newlineRegex = re.compile('.*', re.DOTALL)# This will consider newlines as well
mo2 = newlineRegex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent. \nUphold the law.')
print (mo2.group())
