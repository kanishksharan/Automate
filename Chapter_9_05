Compressing Files with the zipfile Module
You may be familiar with ZIP files (with the .zip file extension), which
can hold the compressed contents of many other files. Compressing a file
reduces its size, which is useful when transferring it over the Internet.
"""

"""
Reading ZIP Files
To read the contents of a ZIP file, first you must create a ZipFile object
(note the capital letters Z and F). ZipFile objects are conceptually similar
to the File objects you saw returned by the open() function in the previous
chapter: They are values through which the program interacts with the file.
To create
a ZipFile object, call the zipfile.ZipFile() function, passing it a
string of the .zip fileâ€™s filename. Note that zipfile is the name of the Python
module, and ZipFile() is the name of the function.
