You can also use the caret symbol (^) at the start of a regex to indicate that
a match must occur at the beginning of the searched text. Likewise, you can
put a dollar sign ($) at the end of the regex to indicate the string must end
with this regex pattern. And you can use the ^ and $ together to indicate
that the entire string must match the regex.
