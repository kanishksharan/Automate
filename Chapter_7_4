import re

print (mo.group())

# Third variation
# Optional matching with text preceding the "?"
"""
The (wo)? part of the regular expression means that the pattern wo is
an optional group. The regex will match text that has zero instances or
one instance of wo in it. This is why the regex matches both 'Batwoman' and
'Batman'.

import re

mo = hero.search ("Ohh my god !!! There goes the Batman !!!")
print (mo.group())

mo2 = hero.search("There she goes....the Batwoman")
print (mo2.group())
