Walking a Directory Tree
Say you want to rename every file in some folder and also every file in every
subfolder of that folder. That is, you want to walk through the directory tree,
touching each file as you go. Writing a program to do this could get tricky;
fortunately, Python provides a function to handle this process for you.

Here is an example program that uses the os.walk()
"""
import os

os.chdir("C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\Oracle_11g\\Pragim")

for folders, subfolders, files in os.walk("C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\Oracle_11g\\Pragim"):
    print ("The current folder: %s"%(folders))

    for subfolder in subfolders:
        print ("The subfolders in the Folder %s are: %s"%(folders,subfolder))

    for file in files:
        print ("The Files in the Folder %s are: %s"%(folders,file))
    print ("\n")
