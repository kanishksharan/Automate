"""
In addition to the search() method, Regex objects also have a findall()
method. While search() will return a Match object of the first matched text
in the searched string, the findall() method will return the strings of every
match in the searched string. To see how search() returns a Match object
only on the first instance of matching text, enter the following into the
interactive shell:
"""
import re
phone = re.compile(r"\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d")
mo = phone.search('Cell: 415-555-9999 Work: 212-555-0000')
print (mo.group())
#o/p = 415-555-9999

mo2 = phone.findall('Cell: 415-555-9999 Work: 212-555-0000')
print (mo2)
