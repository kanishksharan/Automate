Case-Insensitive Matching
Normally, regular expressions match text with the exact casing you specify.

But sometimes you care only about matching the letters without worrying
whether theyâ€™re uppercase or lowercase. To make your regex case-insensitive,
you can pass re.IGNORECASE or re.I as a second argument to re.compile().
Enter the following into the interactive shell:
"""

import re

robocop = re.compile(r'robocop', re.I)
mo = robocop.search('RoboCop is part man, part machine, all cop.')
print (mo.group())

mo1 = robocop.search('ROBOCOP protects the innocent.')
print (mo1.group())

mo2 = robocop.search('Al, why does your programming book talk about robocop so much?')
print (mo2.group())
