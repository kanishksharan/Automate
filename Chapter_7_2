# Searching using Regex

"""
Say you want to separate the area code from the rest of the phone number.
Adding parentheses will create groups in the regex: (\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d).
Then you can use the group() match object method to grab the matching
text from just one group.
The first set of parentheses in a regex string will be group 1. The second
set will be group 2. By passing the integer 1 or 2 to the group() match
object method, you can grab different parts of the matched text. Passing 0
or nothing to the group() method will return the entire matched text.

mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')
print('Phone number found: ' + mo.group())

# re.compile() give the pattern to match
# search() Pass the string that should contain the expected pattern, for the provided pattern
# group() Will match the actual matched text
# Always use raw string. Ex: re.compile(r'pattern')
