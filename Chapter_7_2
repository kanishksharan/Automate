# Searching using Regex

import re
phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')
mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')
print('Phone number found: ' + mo.group())

# re.compile() give the pattern to match
# search() Pass the string that should contain the expected pattern, for the provided pattern
# group() Will match the actual matched text
