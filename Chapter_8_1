"""
On Windows, paths are written using backslashes (\) as the separator
between folder names. OS X and Linux, however, use the forward slash (/)
as their path separator. If you want your programs to work on all operating
systems, you will have to write your Python scripts to handle both cases.
Fortunately, this is simple to do with the os.path.join() function. If you
pass it the string values of individual file and folder names in your path,
os.path.join() will return a string with a file path using the correct path
separators.
