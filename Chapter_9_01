"""
The shutil (or shell utilities) module has functions to let you copy, move,
rename, and delete files in your Python programs. To use the shutil functions,
you will first need to use import shutil.
"""
"""
Calling shutil.copy(source, destination) will copy the file at the path
source to the folder at the path destination. (Both source and destination are
strings.) If destination is a filename, it will be used as the new name of the
copied file. This function returns a string of the path of the copied file.
Enter the following into the interactive shell to see how shutil.copy()
works:
"""
shutil.copy (".\\OG-2016.pdf","C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\OG-2016.pdf")
#O/P = 'C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\OG-2016.pdf'
#Note: The dirs must already exist, that are being passed in the path. No new dir will be created at runtime.

shutil.copy (".\\OG 2016 Verbal review.pdf","C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\Verbal_2016_only.pdf")
#O/P = 'C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\Verbal_2016_only.pdf'
#Note: here the original file has been renamed at the destination.

"""
While shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will
copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it. Calling
shutil.copytree(source, destination) will copy the folder at the path
source, along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path
destination.
The source and destination parameters are both strings. The
function returns a string of the path of the copied folder.
"""
"""
The shutil.copytree() call creates a new folder named bacon_backup with
the same content as the original bacon folder. You have now safely backed up
your precious, precious bacon.
"""
shutil.copytree (".","C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\pragim_bkp")
#O/p = 'C:\\Users\\kanishk\\Desktop\\code_created\\pragim_bkp'
