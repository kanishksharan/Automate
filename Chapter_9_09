"""
The code for this program will be placed into a function named backupToZip().
This will make it easy to copy and paste the function into other Python programs
that need this functionality. At the end of the program, the function
will be called to perform the backup. Make your program look like this:
"""

    import os, zipfile

    # what files already exist.
    number = 1
